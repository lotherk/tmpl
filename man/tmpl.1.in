.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates
.Xr mkstemp 3
file and writes output of
.Ar PROGRAM
to it. Alternativley, when used with
.Ar -c ,
prints generated output to
.Ar STDOUT
and does not create and return a
.Xr mkstemp 3
file.
.Xr mkstemp 3
files are created with mode
.Ar 0600
and set to
.Ar 0400
via
.Xr fchmod 2
after writing STDOUT. The string
.Va @MKSTEMP_TEMPLATE@
is used for
.Xr mkstemp 3 .
.Pp
This utility is especially useful if you need to dynamically create
configuration files for programs.
.Pp
.Nm
does not have any templating language itself, instead it uses STDOUT from whatever you pass to
.Fl p Ar PROGRAM .
.Pp
To use, for example,
.Va erb
you'd do something like this:
.Pp
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -p '/usr/local/bin/erb -T-' /path/to/your.erb
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h, -help
Print help and exit
.It Fl f, -force
Do not abort output generation if
.Ar PROGRAM
fails with one or more
.Ar ARGS .
Use with caution!
.It Fl e, -env Ar KEY=VALUE
Set environment variable KEY to VALUE prior to running
.Ar PROGRAM
or
.Ar COMMAND
.It Fl d, -delete Ar SECONDS
Spawns new process which deletes
.Xr mkstemp 3
file after
.Ar SECONDS
seconds. Value is passed to sleep(3).
.It Fl p, -programm Ar PROGRAM
Run
.Ar PROGRAM
for each given argument in
.Ar ARGS .
Default is
.Ar @DEFAULT_PROGRAM@ .
.It Fl c, -cat
Print output to
.Ar STDOUT
and do not create and return
.Xr mkstemp 3
file. This can not be used with
.Fl r .
.It Fl r, -run Ar COMMAND
Run
.Ar COMMAND
and delete
.Xr mkstemp 3
file on exit. Can not be used with
.Fl r .
You can use the following variables in your
.Ar COMMAND
string to be replaced by
.Nm :
.Pp
.Bk
.Ar %f
-   Path to
.Xr mkstemp 3
generated file
.Ek
.Pp
Example:
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -r 'neomutt -F %f' ~/.mutt/genconf.sh
.It Fl B, -background
Fork to background. Can only be used with
.Fl r .
.It Fl -stdout Ar FILE
Pipe
.Ar STDOUT
from
.Ar COMMAND
to
.Ar FILE .
Can only be used with
.Fl r
.It Fl -stderr Ar FILE
Pipe
.Ar STDERR
from
.Ar COMMAND
to
.Ar FILE .
Defaults to the value of
.Fl -stdout
if not set. Can only be used with
.Fl r .
.El
.Sh FUNCTION
.Nm
calls
.Ar PROGRAM
for each given argument in
.Ar ARGS .
The default for
.Ar PROGRAM
is
.Va @DEFAULT_PROGRAM@ .
.Pp
Example:
.Pp
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -p /bin/sh /path/to/script1.sh /path/to/script2.sh
.Pp
passes script1.sh and script2.sh subsequently to
.Ar PROGRAM
and will result in two system calls:
.Pp
.Dl /bin/sh /path/to/script1.sh
.Dl /bin/sh /path/to/script2.sh
.Pp
If either script fails to execute no output or
.Xr mkstemp 3
file will be generated unless
.Fl f
is used.
.Pp
Example:
.Pp
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -f -r 'httpd -f %f' server.sh vhosts.sh
.Pp
will run httpd with the generated
.Xr mkstemp 3
file as its configuration file even though one of the scripts might have failed. This could lead to an unsafe httpd config or otherwise unwanted behaviour. The use of
.Fl f
is not encouraged unless you are
\fB\really\fR
sure!
.Va STDERR
of
.Ar PROGRAM
is never written to temp file or output.

.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical use case would be running (neo)mutt with multiple accounts using a single
configuration file.
.Pp
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -r 'neomutt -F %f' -e ACCOUNT=k@hiddenbox.org ~/.mutt/mutt-gen-config.sh
.Pp
This will pass ~/.mutt/mutt-gen-config.sh, which is a script that generates a mutt configuration file, to /bin/sh. All output mutt-gen-config.sh generates will be written to a
.Xr mkstemp 3
file which is then read by neomutt. Since neomutt is called by
.Nm
via
.Fl r ,
.Nm
automatically deletes the generated
.Xr mkstemp 3
file as soon as neomutt exits.
.Pp
The same example could also be written as:
.Pp
.Dl neomutt -F $(@PACKAGE@ -e ACCOUNT=k@hiddenbox.org ~/.mutt/mutt-gen-config.sh)
.Pp
but in this case
.Nm
can not remove the
.Xr mkstemp 3
file since it will never know when neomutt exits. A better approach would be something like
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset center
CFG=$(@PACKAGE@ -e ACCOUNT=k@hiddenbox.org ~/.mutt/mutt-gen-config.sh)
neomutt -F $CFG; rm -f $CFG
.Ed
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Dl neomutt -F $(@PACKAGE@ -d 5 -e ACCOUNT=k@hiddenbox.org ~/.mutt/mutt-gen-config.sh)
.Pp
will give neomutt 5 seconds (via
.Fl d )
to read the config from
.Xr mkstemp 3
file, which then gets deleted.
.Pp
Try the following example in your terminal:
.Pp
.Dl cat $(@PACKAGE@ -p /bin/echo 'this is a test')
.Pp
or
.Dl @PACKAGE@ -r 'cat %f' -p /bin/echo 'this is still a test'
.Pp
This should give you a basic overview of what
.Nm
can do for you.
.Sh FEATURES
.Nm
uses
.Xr pledge 2
if available.
.Sh BUGS
The parser for
.Fl r
is pretty bad so don't try to use any fancy shell syntax with quotes or other special chars. It might lead to unexpected behaviour. You should use a wrapper script instead.
.Pp

.Va @PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@ .
