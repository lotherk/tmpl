# tmpl

**tmpl** - Generates [mkstemp(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/mkstemp) file and writes output of `PROGRAM` to it

## Build

### compile
```
# ./bootstrap
# ./configure ...
# make
```

### install
```
# sudo make install
```
## Help
```
<%= %x(tmpl --help) %>
```

## Manpage
```
<%= %x(man 1 tmpl | col -b) %>
```


## Examples

### OpenVPN with config stored in `pass file`
(See [lukrop/pass-file](https://github.com/lukrop/pass-file) for pass file plugin)
```
# tmpl -r "openvpn --config %f" \
                    --stdout /var/log/tmpl.openvpn.log \
                    -p "pass file cat" \
                    "VPN/mysecurevpnconfig"
```

### VIM autocreate file from `erb` template
Add the following to your `~/.vimrc`
```
autocmd BufNewFile * :read !tmpl -c -e AFILE=<afile> -p "erb -T-" ~/.tmpl/code.erb
```

Content for `~/.tmpl/code.erb`
```
<%%
path = ENV['HOME'] + "/.tmpl/code/"
file = ENV['AFILE']
suffix = File.basename(file).split(".").last
template = File.join(path, suffix + ".erb")

if !File.exist?(template)
  exit(0)
end
-%>
<%%= ERB.new(File.read(template), nil, '-', '_sub01').result(binding) -%>
```

`code.erb` will search in `~/.tmpl/code/` for files in the format of `SUFFIX.erb`.

I use this `c.erb` to automatically create *.c files:
